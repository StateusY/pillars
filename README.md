# pillars
Another small datapack.

Planned to have minibosses that you can find around the world in arena structures. These consist of living pillars - 3 blocks tall. Each of the blocks contributes to the minibosses attacks, thus opening oppurtunities to mix and match blocks for a variety of minibosses.

Perhaps they will drop some crystals that can be sold to a wandering enderman.
